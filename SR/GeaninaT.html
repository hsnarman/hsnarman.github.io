        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello!I am Geanina Tambaliuc.Through hard work and dedication, I reached a milestone in my life when I got into Marshall University,West Virginia. 
		I am an international full time Computer Science student (Junior), and I hope to become a professional Computer Scientist some day. 
		Recently, I discovered that research is something that I am passionate about. 
		I invite you to take a look at my work related to cyber-security.
		Feel free to get in touch with me to say hi or for more information about my work.</p>

        <h2>The Project - Automated IP Reputation Analyzer System</h2>
        <p>Over the summer of 2018 I have developed a cross-checking system which automatically analyzes a number of reliable blocklist databases and assign a weighted security degree of domains and IP addresses to inform users and applications about possibilities of malicious activities. My mentor: Dr. Husnu Narman.
		Now, during the fall semester of 2018, I am working with my mentor and fellow group member 
        Jared Lewis on extending this project by adding the machine learning tool. The demand for this is high, as its impossible for blacklists to locate every single malicious domain. On this web page, I will be recording a weekly 
        blog of my research as well as posting the resources I have been using to develop this project.</p>

        <h2>Reports</h2>
         
         <h3>Week One</h3>
         
         <p>I have done the main functions of the program over the summer. Therefore, during my first week of the fall semester, I began to familiarize myself with the machine learning tool. I made some research on how machine learning works and its benefits.</p>
         <hr class="dotted">
         <h3>Week Two</h3>
         
         <p>On the second week, I tried to implement a machine learning problem so I can understand how it works. Since the web application is written in PHP, and the machine learning part in Python, I had to find a way to combine them.
			Therefore, I discovered an easy way to connect the Python program to the PHP script.</p>
         <hr class="dotted">
         
         <h3>Week Three</h3>
         
         <p>This week I made the website mobile friendly as much as possible. Also, I added the database details.</p>
         
		 <hr class="dotted">
         
         <h3>Week Four</h3>
         
         <p>Upon request, I changed the website’s design. Also, I discovered that the UrlVoid database was not working anymore. I tried to figure out what was the problem, but by the end of the week, I concluded that there was a problem with the UrlVoid API. Since there wasn’t a problem with my code and it was something that I could not fix, I decided to remove the UrlVoid database</p>
